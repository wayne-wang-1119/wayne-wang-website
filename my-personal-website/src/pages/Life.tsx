    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Wayne Wang, an AI researcher and software engineer with a
      passion for developing innovative solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my professional journey, I've had the privilege of working with
      cutting-edge technologies at Berkeley EECS and co-founding GotHub.AI,
      where I manage a significant AI project.
    </p>
    <p>
      I specialize in reinforcement learning, cloud computing, and full-stack
      development. Outside of work, I'm an avid reader and tech enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow and make
      a meaningful impact in the field of technology.
